# Chemp Physics Mod Installation Guide
A non-official guide on how to install mods for Chemp Physics V1.7+

## Spawnable Mods
To install a spawnable mod, you will need **at least one** of the following programs:
- [CX File Explorer (Standalone Quest)](#using-cx-file-explorer)
- [SideQuest (PC Only)](#using-sidequest)

### Using CX File Explorer
- Download the `.bundle` file on your headset.  
  *(If the mod is **not** a `.bundle` file, it is likely a [Code Mod](#code-mods).)*
- Open **CX File Explorer**
- Find the `.bundle` file inside your **Downloads** folder
- Press and hold it → **Move**
- Go back to **Home**
- Find **Internal Storage/Main Storage**
- Locate **Android**
- Navigate to:  
  `android\data\com.XORWIREGames.ChempPhysics\files\Mods\Spawnables`
- Move your `.bundle` file into that folder
- Boot up the game — you're ready to go!

### Using SideQuest
- Download the `.bundle` file on your **computer**  
  *(If the mod is **not** a `.bundle` file, it is likely a [Code Mod](#code-mods).)*
- Open **SideQuest**
- Click the **File Folder** icon in the top right
- Navigate to:  
  `android\data\com.XORWIREGames.ChempPhysics\files\Mods\Spawnables`
- Drag and drop your `.bundle` file into that folder
- Boot up the game — you're good to go!

## Code Mods
Installing code mods **is harder**, but definitely worth it due to custom mechanics being possible!

### LemonLoader
- Download the recommended LemonLoader version from the [Chemp Physics Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/nYK5nS8C2y)
- Patch the game (you can find tutorials for this online)
- Once done, open **SideQuest** or **CX File Explorer** and navigate to:  
  `MelonLoader\com.XORWIREGames.ChempPhysics\Mods`
- Drag and drop your mod’s `.dll` file into this folder (along with any dependencies)
- You're done!
